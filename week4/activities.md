 * Produce forecasts using an appropriate benchmark method for household wealth (`hh_budget`). Plot the results using `autoplot()`.
 * Produce forecasts using an appropriate benchmark method for Australian takeaway food turnover (`aus_retail`). Plot the results using `autoplot()`.

  * Compute seasonal na√Øve forecasts for quarterly Australian beer production from 1992.
  * Test if the residuals are white noise. What do you conclude?

 * Fit all the appropriate benchmark methods to the training set and forecast the periods covered by the test set.
 * Compute the accuracy of your forecasts. Which method does best?
 * Repeat the exercise using the Australian takeaway food turnover data (`aus_retail`) with a test set of four years.
