Fit a regression model with a piecewise linear trend with Fourier terms for the US leisure employment data.\n    \n    ```r\n    leisure <- us_employment |>\n      filter(\n        Title == \"Leisure and Hospitality\",\n        year(Month) > 2001\n      ) |>\n      mutate(Employed = Employed / 1000) |>\n      select(Month, Employed)\n    ```\n\n2. Does the model fit well? What are the implications for forecasting?\n\n\n3. Produce forecasts of US leisure employment using your best regression model.\n\n4. Why don't you need to forecast the predictors?\n\n\n\n\n[**R code used in seminar**](seminar_code.R)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Retail Project](../assignments/Project.qmd) is due on Friday 24 May.\n",
