How can you optimize the choice of knot?\n\nThe data can be created as follows.\n\n```r\nvic_elec_daily <- vic_elec |>\n  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>\n  index_by(Date = date(Time)) |>\n  summarise(\n    Demand = sum(Demand)/1e3,\n    Temperature = max(Temperature),\n    Holiday = any(Holiday)\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    Temp2 = I(pmax(Temperature-20,0)),\n    Day_Type = case_when(\n      Holiday ~ \"Holiday\",\n      wday(Date) %in% 2:6 ~ \"Weekday\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Weekend\"\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nRepeat but using all available data, and handling the annual seasonality using Fourier terms.\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Retail Project](../assignments/Project.qmd) is due on Friday 24 May.\n",
