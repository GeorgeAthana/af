Assume distributions independent.\n\n\\pause\n\n**Seasonally adjusted estimate of total employment** (Q4)\n\n* Probably locally trended.\n* Perhaps use drift method based on average monthly change in last 2 years.\n\n# Some case studies\n\n## CASE STUDY 1: Paperware company\n\n\\fontsize{11.5}{13}\\sf\n\n\\begin{textblock}{7.6}(0.2,1.5)\n\\textbf{Problem:} Want forecasts of each of hundreds of\nitems.

How\nshould this affect leasing and sales policies?\n\n\\pause\n\n### Additional information\n - They can provide a large amount of data on previous vehicles and their eventual resale values.\n - The resale values are currently estimated by a group of specialists. They see me as a threat and do not cooperate.\n\n## CASE STUDY 4: Airline\n\n**Problem:** how to forecast passenger traffic on major routes?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-final-thoughts_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\vspace*{10cm}\n\n## CASE STUDY 4: Airline\n\n**Problem:** how to forecast passenger traffic on major routes?\n\n### Additional information\n\n  * They can provide a large amount of data on previous routes.\n  * Traffic is affected by school holidays, special events such as\nthe Grand Prix, advertising campaigns, competition behaviour, etc.\n  * They have a highly capable team of people who are able to do\nmost of the computing.\n\n# Exam\n\n## Exam: 9.00am (AEST) 7 June\n\nFive questions, all to be attempted.\n\nA\n: Short answers/explanations. Write about 1/4 page on four topics (out of six possible topics). Nuanced answers required.\n\nB\n: Describing a time series, choosing a forecasting method\n\nC\n: ETS models\n\nD\n: ARIMA models\n\nE\n: (Dynamic) regression models\n\n\\vspace*{0.3cm}\n\n###\n  $\\bullet$ Moodle Quiz\\qquad $\\bullet$ Open book\\qquad $\\bullet$ 2 hr 40 min\n\n## Exam and R\n\n * Parts \\alert{B}, \\alert{C} and \\alert{E} require interpretation of R output, but no coding.\n * Part \\alert{D} requires some coding (part of the code will be provided) and interpretation of R output.\n * All R coding will be very similar to examples you have done before.\n * Submitted answers will be automatically checked for close matches.\n * Enter answers on Moodle as you go, to avoid internet issues at the end.\n\n## Preparing for the exam\n\n  - Exams from 2018--2020 on Moodle. Solutions to follow by Monday.\n  - Exercises.  Make sure you have done them all!\n  - Identify your weak points and practice them.\n  - Write your own summary of the material.\n  - Practice explaining the material to a class-mate.\n\n\\pause\n\n### Help available\n * Ask on Moodle forum\n * See a tutor during the consultation times.\n\n## Useful resources for forecasters\n\\fontsize{13}{12}\\sf\n\n**Organization:**\n\n * International Institute of Forecasters.\n\n**Annual Conference:**\n\n * International Symposium on Forecasting\n\n**Journals:**\n\n * International Journal of Forecasting\n * Foresight\n\n\\begin{block}{}\nLinks to all of the above at \\textbf{forecasters.org}\n\\end{block}\\pause\n\\begin{block}{}\nGood forecasters are not smarter than everyone else, they merely have their ignorance better organised.\n\\end{block}\\pause\n\\begin{alertblock}{}\\centering\nPlease fill in your SETU\n\\end{alertblock}\n",
