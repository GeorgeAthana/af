We have introduced various functions for time series graphics include `autoplot()`, `gg_season()`, `gg_subseries()`, `gg_lag()` and `ACF`. Use these functions to explore the quarterly tourism data for the Snowy Mountains.\n\n   ```r\n   snowy <- tourism |> filter(Region == \"Snowy Mountains\")\n   ```\n\n   What do you learn?\n\n2. Which time plot corresponds to which ACF plot?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/acf-quiz-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 1](../assignments/A1.qmd) is due on Friday 08 March.\n* [Assignment 2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Sunday 24 March.\n",
