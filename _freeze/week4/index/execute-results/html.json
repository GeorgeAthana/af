Create a training set for household wealth (`hh_budget`) by withholding the last four years as a test set.\n2. Fit all the appropriate benchmark methods to the training set and forecast the periods covered by the test set.\n3. Compute the accuracy of your forecasts. Which method does best?\n4. Do the residuals from the best method resemble white noise?\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Sunday 24 March.\n* [Assignment 3](../assignments/A3.qmd) is due on Friday 12 April.\n",
