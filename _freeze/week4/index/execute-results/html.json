Plot the results using `autoplot()`.\n * Produce forecasts using an appropriate benchmark method for Australian takeaway food turnover (`aus_retail`). Plot the results using `autoplot()`.\n\n  * Compute seasonal na√Øve forecasts for quarterly Australian beer production from 1992.\n  * Test if the residuals are white noise. What do you conclude?\n\n * Create a training set for household wealth (`hh_budget`) by withholding the last four years as a test set.\n * Fit all the appropriate benchmark methods to the training set and forecast the periods covered by the test set.\n * Compute the accuracy of your forecasts. Which method does best?\n * Repeat the exercise using the Australian takeaway food turnover data (`aus_retail`) with a test set of four years.\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Friday 22 March.\n* [Assignment 3](../assignments/A3.qmd) is due on Friday 12 April.\n",
