Write about 3--5 sentences describing the results of the decomposition. Pay particular attention to the scales of the graphs in making your interpretation.\n\n* The Australian labour force has been decomposed into 3 components (trend, seasonality, and remainder) using an STL decomposition.\n* The trend element has been captured well by the decomposition, as it smoothly increases with a similar pattern to the data. The trend is of the same scale as the data (indicated by similarly sized grey bars), and contributes most to the decomposition (having the smallest scale bar).\n* The seasonal component changes slowly throughout the series, with the second seasonal peak diminishing as time goes on -- this component is the smallest contribution original data (having the largest scale bar).\n* The remainder is well behaved until 1991/1992 when there is a sharp drop. There also appears to be a smaller drop in 1993/1994 that should possibly be captured by the trend instead.\n* In the bottom graph, the seasonal component is shown using a sub-series plot. December is the highest employment month, followed by March and September. The seasonal component changes mostly in March (with a decrease in the most recent years). July and August are the months with the next largest changes. The least changing is June with the rest are somewhere between these. December and September show increases in the most recent years.\n\n>   b. Is the recession of 1991/1992 visible in the estimated components?\n\nYes. The residuals show a substantial drop during 1991 and 1992 coinciding with the recession.\n\n# fpp3 3.7, Ex 10\n\n> This exercise uses the `canadian_gas` data (monthly Canadian gas production in billions of cubic metres, January 1960 -- February 2005).\n>\n>   a.
