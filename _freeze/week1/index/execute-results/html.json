Instructions are provided at [https://otexts.com/fpp3/appendix-using-r.html](https://otexts.com/fpp3/appendix-using-r.html).\n* Read [Chapter 1 of the textbook](http://OTexts.com/fpp3/intro.html) and watch all embedded videos\n* Watch this video\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNJYRf0mvxg?si=k0wfI3Sq68TPm4Ek\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Exercises (on your own or in tutorial)\n\nYour task this week is to make sure you are familiar with R, RStudio and the tidyverse packages. If you've already done ETC1010, then you may not need to do anything! But if you're new to R and the tidyverse, then you will need to get yourself up-to-speed.\n\nWork through the first five chapters of the **LearnR** tutorial at [learnr.numbat.space](https://learnr.numbat.space). Do as much of it as you think you need. For those students new to R, it is strongly recommended that you do all five chapters. For those who have previously used R, concentrate on the parts where you feel you are weakest.\n\n\n## Slides for seminar\n\n<embed src='https://af.numbat.space/week1/slides.pdf' type='application/pdf' width='100%' height=465></embed>\n<a href=https://af.numbat.space/week1/slides.pdf class='badge badge-small badge-red'>Download pdf</a>\n\n## Seminar activities\n\n\n1. Download `tourism.xlsx` from [`http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx`](http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx), and read it into R using `read_excel()` from the `readxl` package.\n2. Create a tsibble which is identical to the `tourism` tsibble from the `tsibble` package.\n3. Find what combination of `Region` and `Purpose` had the maximum number of overnight trips on average.\n4. Create a new tsibble which combines the Purposes and Regions, and just has total trips by State.\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 1](../assignments/A1.qmd) is due on Friday 08 March.\n",
