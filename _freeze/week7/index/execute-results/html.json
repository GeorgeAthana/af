Does differencing make the Closing stock price series stationary for Amazon and Apple stocks?\n2. What sorts of transformations and differencing are needed to make the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation` stationary?\n3. Do the unit root tests for the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation`. Do they give the same numbers of difference as you chose?\n\n\n\n\n[**R code used in seminar**](seminar_code.R)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 4](../assignments/A4.qmd) is due on Friday 03 May.\n",
