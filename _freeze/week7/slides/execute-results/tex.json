But it can capture a huge range of time series patterns.\n\n## Stationarity\n\n\\vspace*{0.2cm}\n\\begin{block}{Definition}\nIf $\\{y_t\\}$ is a stationary time series, then for all $s$, the distribution of $(y_t,\\dots,y_{t+s})$ does not depend on $t$.\n\\end{block}\\pause\\vspace*{-0.3cm}\n\nTransformations help to **stabilize the variance**.\\newline\nFor ARIMA modelling, we also need to **stabilize the mean**.\n\n### Differencing\n\n* Differencing helps to **stabilize the mean**.\n* First differencing: *change* between consecutive observations: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$.\n* Seasonal differencing: *change* between years: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-m}$.\n\n\n## Automatic differencing\n\\vspace*{0.2cm}\n\n### Using unit root tests for first differencing\n\n  1. Augmented Dickey Fuller test: null hypothesis is that the data are non-stationary and non-seasonal.\n  2. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test: null hypothesis is that the data are stationary and non-seasonal.\n\n### Seasonal strength\n\nSTL decomposition: $y_t = T_t+S_t+R_t$\n\nSeasonal strength $F_s = \\max\\big(0, 1-\\frac{\\text{Var}(R_t)}{\\text{Var}(S_t+R_t)}\\big)$\n\nIf $F_s > 0.64$, do one seasonal difference.\n\n\n## Random walk model\n\nIf differenced series is white noise with zero mean:\n\n\\begin{block}{}\n\\centerline{$y_t-y_{t-1}=\\varepsilon_t$ \\hspace{0.4cm} or \\hspace{0.4cm} $y_t=y_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_t$}\n\\end{block}\\vspace*{-0.3cm}\nwhere $\\varepsilon_t \\sim NID(0,\\sigma^2)$.\n\n* Model behind the \\alert{na√Øve method}.\n* Forecast are equal to the last observation (future movements up or down are equally likely).\n\n\\vspace*{10cm}\n\n## Random walk with drift model\n\nIf differenced series is white noise with non-zero mean:\n\n\\begin{block}{}\n\\centerline{$y_t-y_{t-1}=c+\\varepsilon_t$ \\hspace{0.4cm} or \\hspace{0.4cm} $y_t=c+y_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_t$}\n\\end{block}\\vspace*{-0.3cm}\nwhere $\\varepsilon_t \\sim NID(0,\\sigma^2)$.\n\n* $c$ is the \\alert{average change} between consecutive observations.\n* Model behind the \\alert{drift method}.\n\n\\vspace*{10cm}\n",
