Produce an STL decomposition as follows\n\n    ```r\n    us_construction <- us_employment |>\n      filter(Title == \"Construction\", year(Month) > 1980)\n    dcmp <- us_construction |>\n      model(stl = STL(Employed ~ trend(window = 9) + season(window = 11)))\n    dcmp |> components() |> autoplot()\n    ```\n2. What happens as you change the values of the two `window` arguments?\n3. How does the seasonal shape change over time? *[Hint:&nbsp;Try&nbsp;plotting the seasonal component using `gg_season`.]*\n4. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? *[Hint:&nbsp;`season_adjust` is returned by `components()`.]*\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Sunday 24 March.\n",
